# Roctoberfest solutions

Samples of community solutions to
[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com)
puzzles, solved using
[the Roc programming language](https://roc-lang.org)
in October 2022 as part of a QA/feedback/social event named "Roctoberfest"

## Context

This was the invitation message for the Roctoberfest event:

>New to Roc? Enjoy puzzles? Want to help Roc by simply writing apps and chatting about your experience? Sign up for Roctoberfest!
>
>The core Roc contributors are recruiting new Roc app developers to use Roc in October to solve a variety of coding puzzles, primarily the fun set from Advent of Code 2021. This will stress test the Roc app dev experience, generate priority feedback/bugs/enhancements to implement in November, and prepare Roc as a language for an expected influx of new users in December. There is no min/max time commitment or participation expectation, we just want you to have fun.
>
>Please also invite any friends/peers in the next few days who you think would enjoy trying Roc for app dev, might provide insightful feedback for us, or just enjoy a coding challenge. ðŸ˜ƒ
